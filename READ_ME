CET 3510 - Microcomputer Systems Technology

Course Description:
An introduction to the basic concepts used in the Personal Computer (PC). 
The role of software, hardware, the CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals is explored. 
More advanced topics include system bus architecture and protocols for communication with peripherals and other computers, including local area networking. 
Emphasis is on selecting hardware and software to meet specified performance requirements. 
Laboratory exercises support the lecture and are carried out in the context of currently available operating systems, including utilities for system setup, benchmarking, and maintenance.

This repository reflects all the laboratory exercises I programmed for this course. 
It was taught in C++ with an addition of the Assembly(x86). 
In all labs, the Professor, for this course, required the ground work to be done in Assembly(x86) and the beautification to be done in C++. 
As in - All calculations, memory management, and other operations are to be done using _asm{} from C++. All variables, and displaying of those variables are to be done using C++.
We used Visual Studio 2022 for this course.
